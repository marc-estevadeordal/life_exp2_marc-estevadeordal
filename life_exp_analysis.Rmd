# Abstract

Here, I re-examine the analysis of Oeppen and Vaupel (2002).

# Analysis

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)

data("gapminder_unfiltered")

# finding the max life exp for each year and country which had
# highest max life exp
gapminder_unfiltered %>% 
  group_by(year) %>%
  filter(lifeExp == max(lifeExp)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(year, country, lifeExp) %>%
  arrange(year) ->
  sumdat
```
